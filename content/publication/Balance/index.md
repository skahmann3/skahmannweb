abstract: Conditional independence relationships serve as the foundation of many observational designs and model assumptions. When evaluating such assumptions, the researcher wishes to falsify their necessary claim, providing evidence in favor of conditional independence. However, current tests are designed to fail to reject, and therefore fail to find evidence against, the intended claim. In this work, I develop an equivalence-based conditional independence test wherein the researcher aims to reject a null of conditional dependence, thus corroborating conditional independence. This test is then applied to causal inference, providing placebo and falsification tests for the conditional ignorability assumption.

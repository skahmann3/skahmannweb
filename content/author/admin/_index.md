In 2021, I was awarded my Statistics Ph.D. from UCLA, receiving funding via the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship from 2019 onward. Broadly, my research focused on leveraging statistical methods to more credibly infer treatment effects and causal relationships.

As a former statistical consultant, I am experienced in applying statistical and causal models to assess real-world impact. I earned my BS in Statistics from UCLA in 2017. In 2018, I co-founded the Society of Women in Statistics at UCLA, recognized and funded by UCLA and the Statistics Department.

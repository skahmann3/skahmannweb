I’m a Statistics Ph.D. Candidate at UCLA funded as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. Broadly, my research focuses on leveraging statistical methods to more credibly infer treatment effects and causal relationships.

As a former statistical consultant, I am experienced in applying statistical and causal models to assess real-world impact. I earned my BS in Statistics from UCLA in 2017. In 2018, I co-founded the Society of Women in Statistics at UCLA, recognized and funded by UCLA and the Statistics Department.

Aside from statistics, I am an avid board gamer, aspiring wood carver, and Oakland A’s fan.

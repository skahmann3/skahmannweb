I am a Statistics PhD student at UCLA and earned my BS in Statistics from UCLA in 2017. As of 2019, I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. 

I'm currently working on a few projects in causal inference with my advisor, Dr. Erin Hartman, including an equivalence testing R package coming to CRAN in a few months. 

Since October 2017, I have served as a graduate consultant for the UCLA Statistical Consulting Center. Through this role, I work with a small consulting team to devise and implement tailor-made analysis plans for clients in applied research and product development from the Los Angeles area. 

This fall, I co-founded the Society of Women in Statistics at UCLA. Check out our [website](http://statistics.ucla.edu/groups/sws/) for more information and photos from past events.

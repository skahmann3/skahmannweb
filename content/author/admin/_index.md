As a social statistician and data scientist, I'm first and foremost a communicator and storyteller. I leverage data using advanced machine learning and analytics techniques to answer applied problems. In my work as a Statistics PhD student at UCLA, I also develop new methods if existing approaches don't provide a satisfactory answer to the motivating, real-world questions. 

My dissertation research is in causal inference, advised by Dr. Erin Hartman. As of 2019, I am a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. Currently, I'm both applying existing approaches and developing new methodology to evaluate Los Angeles crime policies as part of larger interdisciplinary research teams of academics, activists, community leaders, and police officers.

Not only am I passionate about data, I'm also passionate about advancing underrepresented groups in STEM. In 2018, I co-founded the Society of Women in Statistics at UCLA, recognized and funded by UCLA and the Statistics Department. I serve as co-president of the organization, managing a leadership board as we host professional events for students, staff, and faculty.

I’m a Statistics Ph.D. Candidate at UCLA advised by Dr. Erin Hartman and funded as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. Broadly, my research focuses on leveraging statistical methods to more credibly infer treatment effects and causal relationships. Currently, I’m developing new ways to assess the believability of the unverifiable assumptions required for most common causal designs.

As a former statistical consultant, I am experienced in applying statistical and causal models to assess real-world impact. I earned my BS in Statistics from UCLA in 2017. In 2018, I co-founded the Society of Women in Statistics at UCLA, recognized and funded by UCLA and the Statistics Department.

Aside from statistics, I am an avid board gamer, aspiring wood carver, and Oakland A’s fan.

My dissertation research is in causal inference, advised by Dr. Erin Hartman. Currently, I'm developing new synthetic control methodology to evaluate Los Angeles crime policies as part of interdisciplinary policy evaluation teams. Previously, I developed an R package implementing equivalence versions of statistical tests used to evaluate common causal design assumptions, publicly hosted on Github. 

I'm also passionate about advancing underrepresented groups in STEM. In 2018, I co-founded the Society of Women in Statistics at UCLA, recognized and funded by UCLA and the Statistics Department. I serve as co-president of the organization, managing a leadership board as we host professional events for students, staff, and faculty.

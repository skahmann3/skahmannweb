Following a relationship-based policing model, officers were assigned to work collaboratively with community members to reduce crime and build trust.  However, evaluating the causal impact of this policy intervention is difficult given the unique nature of the units and time period where CSP was implemented.  In this paper, we use a novel data set based on the LAPD's reported crime incidents and calls-for-service data to evaluate the effectiveness of this program via augmented synthetic control models, a cutting-edge method for policy evaluation. We do rigorous testing using numerous falsification analyses, to evaluate the robustness of the results. In the public housing developments where it was first deployed, CSP reduced reported violent crime incidents and shots fired and violent crime calls, starting roughly three years post-implementation. We do not find evidence of crime displacement from CSP regions to neighboring control regions.  These results are promising for policy-makers interested in policing reform.","tags":[],"title":"Impact Evaluation of the LAPD Community Safety Partnership","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594710000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594710000,"objectID":"bce45c5121cf4317c7981fc925fe3bee","permalink":"/talk/polmeth2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/polmeth2020/","section":"talk","summary":"In 2011, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), in conjunction with other governmental and nonprofit groups, launched the Community Safety Partnership (CSP).

This technical report  describes  a  Graphical User Interface(GUI) called CMIViz developed as part of the 2016 REU program at UMBC. CMIViz is an R tool used for exploration and visualization of spatio-temporal climate data from the Missouri River Basin (MRB). The tool is developed using the R package ‘Shiny’, which facilitates access on a web browser.  Since prediction of precipitation is more challenging than the prediction of  maximum/minimum temperatures, CMIViz provides more visualization  options  for  precipitation. Specifically,  the  tool  provides  an  easy  intercomparison of data from the Global Climate Models (GCM): MIROC5, HadCM3, and NCAR-CCSM4 in terms of bias relative to the observed data, root mean-squared error (RMSE), and other measures of interest for daily precipitation.  The tool has options to explore the temporal trends and autocorrelation patterns given a location and spatial patterns using contour plots, surface plots, and semivariograms given a time point. CMIViz also provides visualization of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to help find similarities between the models.","tags":["Graphical user interface (GUI)","Global Climate Models (GCM)","Missouri River Basin (MRB)","spatio-temporal analysis","exploratory data analysis (EDA)","MIROC5","HadCM3","NCAR-CCSM4"],"title":"Enhanced Data Exploration and Visualization Tool for Large Spatio-Temporal Climate Data","type":"publication"}]

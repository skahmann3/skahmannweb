When evaluating such assumptions, the researcher wishes to falsify their necessary claim, providing evidence in favor of conditional independence. However, current tests are designed to fail to reject, and therefore fail to find evidence against, the intended claim. In this work, I develop an equivalence-based conditional independence test wherein the researcher aims to reject a null of conditional dependence, thus corroborating conditional independence. This test is then applied to causal inference, providing placebo and falsification tests for the conditional ignorability assumption.","tags":[],"title":"An Equivalence Test for Conditional Independence Hypotheses","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613721600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613721600,"objectID":"f7275002f935ad6ca87d44e044220a65","permalink":"https://skahmann3.github.io/talk/asa-csp-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-19T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/asa-csp-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Amidst the push for data-driven decision making, policymakers increasingly rely on statisticians to evaluate program effectiveness before allocating additional resources to policy expansion. To estimate the effect of a policy, one must infer what would have happened to the treated unit had it not received treatment. This causal inference problem is further complicated by the hallmarks of many policy problems: observational data, few or one treated unit(s), site-selection bias, and an imperfect pool of naturally-occurring controls. We introduce synthetic control methods, an important advancement that aims to alleviate these problems by estimating a synthetic control, a combination of control units constructed to mirror the treated unit in terms of pre-treatment characteristics. However, with so few treated units, researchers must carefully justify model-based decisions and quantify uncertainty in communicating final results to clients. Using a recent application in community policing, we implement the augmented synthetic control method and demonstrate how falsification tests can supplement model output to contextualize the substantive significance of results.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating Policy and Quantifying Uncertainty with Few (or One) Treated Unit(s): An Introduction to Synthetic Control Methods and Falsification Analyses","type":"talk"},{"authors":["S Kahmann","E Hartman","J Leap","P.J.

Following a relationship-based policing model, officers were assigned to work collaboratively with community members to reduce crime and build trust. However, evaluating the causal impact of this policy intervention is difficult given the unique nature of the units and time period where CSP was implemented.  In this paper, we use a novel data set based on the LAPD's reported crime incidents and calls-for-service to evaluate the effectiveness of this program via augmented synthetic control models, a cutting-edge method for policy evaluation. We perform falsification analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results. In the public housing developments where it was first deployed, CSP reduced reported violent crime incidents, shots fired and violent crime calls, and Part I reported crime incidents. We do not find evidence of crime displacement from CSP regions to neighboring control regions.  These results are promising for policy-makers interested in policing reform.","tags":[],"title":"Impact Evaluation of the LAPD Community Safety Partnership","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594710000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594710000,"objectID":"bce45c5121cf4317c7981fc925fe3bee","permalink":"https://skahmann3.github.io/talk/polmeth2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/polmeth2020/","section":"talk","summary":"In 2011, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), in conjunction with other governmental and nonprofit groups, launched the Community Safety Partnership (CSP).
